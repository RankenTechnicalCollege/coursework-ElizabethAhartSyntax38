            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p> The importance of using Descriptive file names is strong. To locate and use the file quickly you must understand where the file originates, thus Descriptive file names are needed.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p> I used the paint application to resize the photo. i simply went to the files location , right click and selected open with paint. I then went to the properties of the file a dialog box listed the properties of length width ect. i changed and hit save before closing the application.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The Original size i should of noted , but that would make me genius as well . the original size was very large a width of over 4222 pixels the height i cant recall but very very large.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="c:\Users\ahart\Downloads\coursework-ElizabethAhartSyntax38\html-css\data-files\chapter03\extend\Images\HTML5.jpg" height="500" width="333" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>To reduce the file size I used the image compressor TinyJPG. before the file is 500x333 our own zip, then when adding the tiny compression application you will no see the file is still 500by333. so , that leads me to believe that i must edit further to reduce the size more to get an  updated size.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="c:\Users\ahart\Downloads\coursework-ElizabethAhartSyntax38\html-css\data-files\chapter03\extend\Images\HTML5_min.jpg.jpg" height="500" width="333" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>I cant see any visual changes at all the same image with two different file names , makes me want to go back and resize the tinyjpg vs the html5 just so the appears zoomed and different from one another.</p>
