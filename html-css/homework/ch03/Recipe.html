    <h1>"THE COBB SALAD"</h1>
    <p>My favorite RECIPE is the Cobb Salad .</p>

        <li>1/4 cup Red Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 small Garlic clove minced</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Ground Pepper</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Fresh Chives</li>

        <dt>DIRECTIONS ARE INCLUDE AS : STep 1 MAKE THE DRESSING</dt>
         <dd>This vinaigrette couldn’t be easier to make. Combine all the ingredients (except the oils) in a blender or food processor. With the motor running, gradually add the canola and olive oils in a steady stream to create an emulsification. Store the dressing in the refrigerator until it’s time to eat. Give it a firm shake or whisk it before using it.</dd>
        <dt>STEP TWO :GET CHOPPING</dt>
         <dd>This is the only time-consuming part of this recipe, but it can be done in advance if you like. Store each chopped ingredient separately in airtight containers until you’re ready to compose the salad.We’ll start with the greens: Wash and chop the romaine, endive and watercress. To keep lettuce from wilting, make sure the lettuce is spun as dry as possible. Then, chop the chicken, tomatoes, avocado and eggs into 1/2- to 1-inch, bite-sized pieces. For the cheese and bacon, you won’t need a knife at all; these ingredients should crumble in your hands.</dd>
        <dt>Step Three: COMPOSE AND DRESS</dt>
         <dd>Now comes the fun part! Toss the lettuces together and place them in a large bowl or on a platter. Arrange each of the remaining ingredients in a pattern over the lettuce. You can make a line of each ingredient, or you can place piles of each in colorful circles. Feel free to sprinkle everything randomly, and the salad will still taste great!Finish the salad by topping it with the chives. When you’re ready to eat, drizzle 1 cup of the dressing over the salad, serving the remaining dressing on the side if you choose.</dd>
